### Diabetes Prediction Web API

This project implements a web API for predicting diabetes risk based on a trained machine learning model. The model, a neural network, has been trained on a dataset containing information such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, and more.

### Features:

FastAPI Backend: Utilizes FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
Scikit-Learn Model: The project incorporates a trained Scikit-Learn model for accurate diabetes predictions.
Model Deployment: A deployed version of the model ready to be integrated into web applications.
Swagger Documentation: The API comes with Swagger UI documentation for easy exploration and understanding of available endpoints.
Test Data: Includes sample test data for validating predictions.
How to Use:

Send a POST request to the /diabetes_prediction endpoint with input parameters in the request body.
Receive predictions indicating whether a person is diabetic or not.
